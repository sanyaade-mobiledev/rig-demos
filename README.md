Rig Demos
==

This repo provides a collection of examples that can be run by the [Rig designer & UI engine](https://github.com/01org/rig)

To run an example such as fox-goose-ui.xml simply pass Rig the path to the UI xml file you want to load such as:

    $ rig /path/to/rig-demos/fox-goose-ui.xml

This will load the UI in the Rig design tool but if you instead just want to run the UI you can run Rig in device mode like this:

    $ rig -d /path/to/rig-demos/fox-goose-ui.xml
